Growth of the internet	-> extra challenges on ISP to provide good quality
			-> extra issues in traffic engineering (eg. LSPs and LSRs setup) LS{P,R} = Label switched {Path, routers}
			-> flip-side has provided with many redundant paths
			-> therefore enhancing the potential for multipath algorithms

Today's Internet	-> Many implemented on SPF technology
			-> limiting the throughput between any pair
			-> To solve congestion problems. Global optimization adjusting link costs (NP-Hard)
				    (papers 1, 2 & 5 )

		(Possible include the gimmick here)

The Benefit of Multipath-> Simple example portraying:
			      - Path Quantity
			      - Path Independance
			-> aggregate bandwidth
			-> Recomputation can be preformed off-line
			-> increased resiliency to failure.
			-> Two aspects of multipath + link to contribution
				      (Paper 3)

Attributes of Multipath	-> Load-Balancing
			-> Quality of service

Contributions		-> Decoupling the underlying optimization problem into a set of local problems (Paper 4)
			-> Guaranteed stability by avoiding oscillations
			-> Topology Representation
			-> In Network monitoring
			-> Solution can co-exist with existing routing tech.
			-> Media indepandance.
