The StyleFiles are needed for this thesis layout.

Upon inicial compilation, a set of files with a .gnuplot extension is generated. These files must be passed through gnuplot to generate .table files. Then, the thesis must be recompiled and all plots will look GREAT!

That said, depending on the tex build used to do the build the above process may occur automatically.

PS. Oh and don't forget to compile the bibtext as well….
