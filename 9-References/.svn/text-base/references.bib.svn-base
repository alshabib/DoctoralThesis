	approach to explaining how networks work from the inside out. He
	starts with an explanation of the physical layer of networking, computer
	hardware and transmission systems; then works his way up to network
	applications. Tanenbaum's in-depth application coverage includes
	email; the domain name system; the World Wide Web (both client- and
	server-side); and multimedia (including voice over IP, Internet radio
	video on demand, video conferencing, and streaming media. Each chapter
	follows a consistent approach: Tanenbaum presents key principles,
	then illustrates them utilizing real-world example networks that
	run through the entire bookâ€”the Internet, and wireless networks,
	including Wireless LANs, broadband wireless and Bluetooth. This new
	Fourth Edition contains a new chapter devoted exclusively to network
	security. The textbook is supplemented by a Solutions Manual, as
	well as a Website containing PowerPoint slides, art in various forms,
	and other tools for instruction, including a protocol simulator whereby
	students can develop and test their own network protocols.},

	abstract = "An algorithm is defined for establishing routing tables in the individual nodes of a data network. The routing table at a node<tex>i</tex>specifies, for each other node<tex>j</tex>, what fraction of the traffic destined for node<tex>j</tex>should leave node<tex>i</tex>on each of the links emanating from node<tex>i</tex>. The algorithm is applied independently at each node and successively updates the routing table at that node based on information communicated between adjacent nodes about the marginal delay to each destination. For stationary input traffic statistics, the average delay per message through the network converges, with successive updates of the routing tables, to the minimum average delay over all routing assignments. The algorithm has the additional property that the traffic to each destination is guaranteed to be loop free at each iteration of the algorithm. In addition, a new global convergence theorem for noncontinuous iteration algorithms is developed.",

There is a real sense in which the deepest results are concerned with their interplay. One, the Bachelier Wiener model of Brownian motion, has been the subject of many books. The other, the Poisson process, seems at first sight humbler and less worthy of study in its own right. Nearly every book mentions it, but most hurry past to more general point processes or Markov chains. This comparative neglect is ill judged, and stems from a lack of perception of the real importance of the Poisson process. This distortion partly comes about from a restriction to one dimension, while the theory becomes more natural in more general context. This book attempts to redress the balance. It records Kingman's fascination with the beauty and wide applicability of Poisson processes in one or more dimensions. The mathematical theory is powerful, and a few key results often produce surprising consequences.",

This result has applications in problems of tandem queuing. The essence of the proof is the demonstration of the independence of an interdeparture interval and the state of the system at the end of the interval.
