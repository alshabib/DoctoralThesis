In this chapter we will present the most notable results which were obtained
from our real-world testbed implementation. First, we will present a scenario
in which our protocols perform exceptionally well. Then, we show that even in
the extreme worst cases, our protocols still present an improvement over the
legacy. Finally, we show how the latency and packet loss are affected by our
protocols. But before presenting the results we should introduce the topologies
on which the results where generated.

\section{Test Topologies \& Associated Routing Tables}

The Flower, shown in Figure \ref{fig:flower}, is the first topology we present.
It consists on a fully connected sqare with two networks at either side of this
network. This topology is quite common in campus networks as it provides
rudundant paths between the exterior networks (SW1 and SW6 in this case). While
it contains relatively many links it only delivers a maximum of two absolutely
independent paths from any source to any destination.

    \begin{tabular}{| c | c || c | c | c | c | c | c |}
    \hline
      \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{\multirow{2}{*}{}}  &
\multicolumn{6}{|c|}{Destination} \\
    \cline{3-8}
       \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{} & SW1 & SW2 & SW3 & SW4 & SW5 & SW6 \\

    & SW2 & 47 & L & 45 & 43 & 41 & [43, 41] \\
    & SW3 & 48 & 45 & L & 39 & 37 & [37, 39] \\
    & SW4 & [43, 39] & 43 & 39 & L & 46 & 37\\
    & SW5 & [41, 37] & 41 & 37 & 46 & L & 40 \\
    & SW6 & [38, 40] & [38, 40] & [38, 40] & 38 & 40 & LOCAL \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}

\label{tab:flowerRoute}
\end{table}

The low number of independent paths means that the oppourtunity for leveraging
the alternative paths is reduced. Therefore, the fullmesh runs should
display similar results regardless of the protocol used. It's associated
routing table is shown in Table \ref{tab:flowerRoute}.

The next topology used is called the Pentagon due to its pentagonal shape. This
topology presents many more alternative paths from any source to any
destination. This topology is also quite common in campus networks as the
consists of a starpoint centered on SW6, each neighboring network is then
connected to each other to provide redundancy. The routing table is shown in
Table \ref{pentagonRoute}.

\multicolumn{6}{|c|}{Destination} \\
    \cline{3-8}
       \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{} & SW1 & SW2 & SW3 & SW4 & SW5 & SW6 \\
    \hline
    \multirow{6}{*}{\rotatebox{90}{Source}} & SW1 & L & 26 & 27 & [26,25] &
[27,25] & 25 \\
    & SW2 & 26 & L & [26, 27] & 28 & [27, 28, 26] & 27 \\
    & SW3 & 27 & [27, 29] & L & [29, 30, 27] & 30 & 29 \\
    & SW4 & [28, 31] & 28 & [31, 32, 28] & L & 32 & 31\\
    & SW5 & [30, 33] & [32, 33] & 30 & 32 & L & 33 \\
    & SW6 & 25 & 27 & 29 & 31 & 33 & L  \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \caption{The routing table associated to the Pentagon topology.}
\label{tab:pentagonRoute}
\end{table}

It should be also noted that the entries in the routing tables are sorted by
distance to the destinaion. Therefore, the leftmost entry is the shortest to
the destination.
